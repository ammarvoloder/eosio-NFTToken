# EOSIO NFTToken

This project represents an implementation of a non-fungible token on the EOSIO blockchain following the [dGoods](https://github.com/MythicalGames/dgoods) open source standard. The token is created and used to demonstrate a simple use case of creating and transferring an ownership of a custom non-fungible token from one account to another.
